# GitHub

A lot of the magic that is Bugo counts on GitHub. You'll need a GitHub account to get started, so head on over to GitHub and get one. We'll wait. 

Now that you've got your account, you'll have to make a choice. Do you want to use an off the shelf design, or do you want to install on your computer to fully customize your site?

# One Click Installs

If you want to use one of our themes of the shelf, you can use anyone of our super easy One Click Installs. Head over to our One Click Installs page and follow the directions there.

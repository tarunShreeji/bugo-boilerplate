## Installing Bugo Locally

Looks like you want to go whole hog. In order to customize your site, beyond the Bugo theme's capabilities you'll need to install Bugo locally. You should have some basic skills to proceed. We'll assume you've got basic web development skills.

You'll need the following accounts. For more info go to the [accounts page](/docs/accounts/ "Read more about necessary accounts.").

### Prerequisites

You need to have the latest/LTS [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) versions installed in order to use Bugo.

### Create Website

We'll setup a website at the CMS service Forestry.io by clicking the button below.

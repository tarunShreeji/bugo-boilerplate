Bugo is a framework designed to make developing full-featured websites using a JAMstack. By combining a few services and a development platform, Bugo does away with all the databases, security issues, and plugin updates. Freeing you up to have fun again and build an awesome website.

## Accounts

JAMstack is a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience. Bugo uses a JAMStack approach to developing and deploying websites, you'll need to have a few accounts before you get started. Read below to determine which accounts you'll need.

### GitHub

A lot of the magic that is Bugo counts on GitHub repositories. You'll need a GitHub account to get started. Fortunately you can use your GitHub account to create most of the other accounts you'll need. If you have one already, great. If not, head on over to GitHub and get one. We'll wait.

### Content Management System

You'll need a way to create and edit content on your website, so sign up for an account at [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io "Create an account at forestry.io"). NOTE: you can use you're GitHub account to keep those login and passwords down.

      ## FEE-ONLY, NOT FEE BASED

      ### OUR FEES ARE BASED ON WHAT WE HELP YOU EARN, NOT ON HOW MUCH OR WHAT PRODUCTS WE CAN SELL YOU.

      Oder Investment Management is a fee-only adviser, independent of Wall Street influences. We are not paid commissions and we don’t have to trade your account to generate income. Since our fees are based on a percentage of assets under management, we’re clearly aligned with your interests. We are compensated more when your portfolio grows and you achieve your financial objectives.

      ### THE BENEFITS OF AN INDEPENDENT, FEE-ONLY INVESTMENT ADVISER ARE CLEAR:

      * No hidden sales fees
      * No pressure to buy/sell investments for commission gains
      * Personal, ongoing relationship with the person managing your money
      * Sharing the same goal: the achievement of your financial objectives
      * Adjustments are made as market conditions or personal circumstances warrant
      * Development of a customized investment plan based on a thorough needs assessment and then tailored to your risk tolerance, current needs and long-term financial goals

      ## FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBLITY

      ### OUR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY IS OUR COMMITMENT TO PUTTING YOUR NEEDS ABOVE ALL ELSE.

      We are held to a fiduciary standard by the Securities and Exchange Commission to always work in the best interest of our clients and to avoid conflicts of interests. One would think this would be the industry standard, but it is not. There is a “suitability standard” in place for some advisers where they only must have adequate reason to believe a recommendation fits for a client’s financial situation. An adviser held to this standard can steer you into products that pay him or her a commission if it’s considered suitable for you. At Oder Investment Management we provide independent investment advice to our clients and are compensated on a fee only basis and not on a commission basis.
